The two scripts are ikFKMatching and GlobalPositioning

*ikFkMatching* allows the animator to match ik and fk controls.
After selecting the limb's ikfk_switch control,
press either "FK to IK" to match Fk controls to Ik controls or "IK to FK" to match Ik controls to Fk controls.  

*GlobalPositioning* allows the animator to move their pose based on a chosen pivot(a control or locator).
Select the pivot and then press "Set Pivot".
Avatarah Game Rigs' target controls automatically load.
Press "Capture Pose" to save the rig's current pose.
Move and/or rotate the pivot then press "Snap Pose" to move the rig's pose to match the change in position and orientation.
